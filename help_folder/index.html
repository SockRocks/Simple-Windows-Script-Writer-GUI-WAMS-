    <h2>What is WAMS?</h2>
        
        
        
        <div id="intro">
                <p>WAMS is a program written in Python used to write Windows batch scripts without type-errors, and efficiently. WAMS allows you to make:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Games</li>
        <li>Automation Scripts</li>
            <li>File Management Scripts</li>
        <li>Console Based Animations</li>
        <li>Execute Console Commands Without Memorization</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        </div>

            <!--Declaring Variables!-->
        <h3 id="f1" class="manual">Declaring Keys/Variables</h3>
            <p class="manual">What is a <dfn>key</dfn>? A key is a string that stands for an integer, float, or a string. Keys can be used for user interactment within your program, or as a comparison agent. To declare keys in your program click the properties menu, and click the Keys tab. This will open up text areas that will ask of a key name, then a value. You can see all of the previously declared keys throughout your program in the order they have been declared in the key menu in the top right. In order to access your variables in other parts of the program that accept them, add a dash in front of your key name like so, -key_name. <span class="important">Make sure your variable names do not include spaces.</span></p>
        
            
            <!--Background Programs!-->
        <h3 class="manual">Background Programs</h3>
            <p class="manual">A <dfn>background program</dfn> is a program that is not directly opened in the foreground, but instead executes the code from the background program in your program, temporarily pausing your program to execute the code within the background program's; afterwards, your program immediatly resumes. In WAMS there are two methods of executing background programs. One method is where your program executes the background program using the <dfn>absolute path</dfn>, this is where the background program can only be executed in a certain location in your computer, such as C:\Users\[USER]\OneDrive\Documents\file.bat. The other method WAMS uses to execute background programs is through <dfn>relative paths</dfn>. Through the relative paths your program is more dynamic, allowing it to be executed from any location, so as long as it is in the same directory, or grandchild directory as your current program.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <!--Packages Section!-->
        <h3 class=manual>Packages</h3>
            <p class="manual">What is a <dfn>package?</dfn> A package is pre-written code, either by you, or someone else. In order to use packages place them inside of the packages folder within your current project; projects appear as blank files without file extensions.</p>
            
            <h4 class="manual">How to Create a Package</h4>
            <p class="manual"> To create your own package in WAMS, write a script within WAMS; afterwards, click the file menu, then click save as a package. Your file will be saved automatically into the packages folder within your project <span class="important">in order to use your package in other scripts copy the package from your current project's package folder, into the new project's package folder.</span> In order to add your package into the actual script, exit the batchmain file and reload it. After this click on the packages menu and look for your project's name.</p>
            
            <h4 class="manual">Where to Get Packages</h4>
            <p class="manual"> To get packages, either go to the home site of WAMS, or find a batch script, and copy and paste the code into a file without an extension; afterwards, move this file into your current project's packages folder.</p>
            
            
          <!--How to Delete Code with paths!-->  
        <h3 class="manual">Deleting Code with Paths</h3>
            <p class="manual">When deleting code that contains paths you don't need to enter the path. All you have to do is enter the command as shown in the command log.</p>
        
            
            <h3 class="manual">When is it Ok to Move a Script?</h3>
            <p class="manual">It is ok to move your script whenever you want.</p>
